    "# Concise implementation of linear regression\n",
    "\n",
    "Broad and intense interest in deep learning for the past several years has inspired companies, academics, and hobbyists to develop a variety of mature open source frameworks for automating the repetitive work of implementing gradient-based learning algorithms. In :numref:`sec_linear_scratch`, we relied only on (i) tensors for data storage and linear algebra; and (ii) auto differentiation for calculating gradients. In practice,  because data iterators, loss functions, optimizers, and neural network layers are so common, modern libraries implement these components for us as well.\n",

    "## Defining the model\n",
    "\n",
    "When we implemented linear regression from scratch, we defined our model parameters explicitly and coded up the calculations to produce output using basic linear algebra operations. You *should* know how to do this. But once your models get more complex, and once you have to do this nearly every day, you will be glad for the assistance. The situation is similar to coding up your own blog from scratch. Doing it once or twice is rewarding and instructive, but you would be a lousy web developer if every time you needed a blog you spent a month reinventing the wheel.\n",
    "\n",
    "For standard operations, we can use a framework's predefined layers, which allow us to focus especially on the layers used to construct the model rather than having to focus on the implementation. We will first define a model variable `net`, which will refer to an instance of the `Sequential` class. The `Sequential` class defines a container for several layers that will be chained together. Given input data, a `Sequential` instance passes it through the first layer, in turn passing the output as the second layer's input and so forth. In the following example, our model consists of only one layer, so we do not really need `Sequential`. But since nearly all of our future models will involve multiple layers, we will use it anyway just to familiarize you with the most standard workflow.\n",
