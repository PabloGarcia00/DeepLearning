that we could address the problem\n","with a simple preprocessing fix.\n","That is because the significance of any pixel\n","depends in complex ways on its context\n","(the values of the surrounding pixels).\n","While there might exist a representation of our data\n","that would take into account\n","the relevant interactions among our features,\n","on top of which a linear model would be suitable,\n","we simply do not know how to calculate it by hand.\n","With deep neural networks, we used observational data\n","to jointly learn both a representation via hidden layers\n","and a linear predictor that acts upon that representation.\n","\n","\n","### Incorporating Hidden Layers\n","\n","We can overcome these limitations of linear models\n","and handle a more general class of functions\n","by incorporating one or more hidden layers.\n","The easiest way to do this is to stack\n","many fully-connected layers on top of each other.\n","Each layer feeds into the layer above it,\n","until we generate outputs.\n","We can think of the first $L-1$ layers\n","as our representation and the final layer\n","as our linear predictor.\n","This architecture is commonly called\n","a *multilayer perceptron*,\n","often abbreviated as *MLP*.\n","Below, we depict an MLP diagrammatically (:numref:`fig_mlp`).\n","\n","![An MLP with a hidden layer of 5 hidden units. ](http://d2l.ai/_images/mlp.svg)\n",":label:`fig_mlp`\n","\n","This MLP has 4 inputs, 3 outputs,\n","and its hidden layer contains 5 hidden units.\n","Since the input layer does not involve any calculations,\n","producing outputs with this network\n","requires implementing the computations\n","for both the hidden and output layers;\n","thus, the number of layers in this MLP is 2.\n","Note that these layers are both fully connected.\n","Every input influences every neuron in the hidden layer,\n","and each of these in turn influences\n","every neuron in the output layer.\n","However, as suggested by :numref:`subsec_parameterization-cost-fc-layers`,\n","the parameterization cost of MLPs\n","with fully-connected layers\n","can be prohibitively high,\n","which may motivate\n","tradeoff between parameter saving and model effectiveness even without changing the input or output size :cite:`Zhang.Tay.Zhang.ea.2021`.\n","\n","\n","\n","### From Linear to Nonlinear\n","\n","\n","As before, by the matrix $\\mathbf{X} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times d}$,\n","we denote a minibatch of $n$ examples where each example has $d$ inputs (features).\n","For a one-hidden-layer MLP whose hidden layer has $h$ hidden units,\n","denote by $\\mathbf{H} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times h}$\n","the outputs of the hidden layer, which are\n","*hidden representations*.\n","In mathematics or code, $\\mathbf{H}$ is also known as a *hidden-layer variable* or a *hidden variable*.\n","Since the hidden and output layers are both fully connected,\n","we have hidden-layer weights $\\mathbf{W}^{(1)} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d \\times h}$ and biases $\\mathbf{b}^{(1)} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{1 \\times h}$\n","and output-layer weights $\\mathbf{W}^{(2)} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{h \\times q}$ and biases $\\mathbf{b}^{(2)} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{1 \\times q}$.\n","Formally, we calculate the outputs $\\mathbf{O} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times q}$\n","of the one-hidden-layer MLP as follows:\n","\n","$$\n","\\begin{aligned}\n","    \\mathbf{H} & = \\mathbf{X} \\mathbf{W}^{(1)} + \\mathbf{b}^{(1)}, \\\\\n","    \\mathbf{O} & = \\mathbf{H}\\mathbf{W}^{(2)} + \\mathbf{b}^{(2)}.\n","\\end{aligned}\n","$$\n","\n","\n","\n","Note that after adding the hidden layer,\n","our model now requires us to track and update\n","additional sets of parameters.\n","So what have we gained in exchange?\n","You might be surprised to find out\n","that---in the model defined above---*we\n","gain nothing for our troubles*!\n","The reason is plain.\n","The hidden units above are given by\n","an affine function of the inputs,\n","and the outputs (pre-softmax) are just\n","an affine function of the hidden units.\n","An affine function of an affine function\n","is itself an affine function.\n","Moreover, our linear model was already\n","capable of representing any affine function.\n","\n","\n","We can view the equivalence formally\n","by proving that for any values of the weights,\n","we can just collapse out the hidden layer,\n","yielding an equivalent single-layer model with parameters\n","$\\mathbf{W} = \\mathbf{W}^{(1)}\\mathbf{W}^{(2)}$ and

of multilayer architectures,\n","we need one more key ingredient: a\n","nonlinear *activation function* $\\sigma$\n","to be applied to each hidden unit\n","following the affine transformation.\n","The outputs of activation functions\n","(e.g., $\\sigma(\\cdot)$)\n","are called *activations*.\n","In general, with activation functions in place,\n","it is no longer possible to collapse our MLP into a linear model:\n","\n","\n","$$\n","\\begin{aligned}\n","    \\mathbf{H} & = \\sigma(\\mathbf{X} \\mathbf{W}^{(1)} + \\mathbf{b}^{(1)}), \\\\\n","    \\mathbf{O} & = \\mathbf{H}\\mathbf{W}^{(2)} + \\mathbf{b}^{(2)}.\\\\\n","\\end{aligned}\n","$$\n","\n","Since each row in $\\mathbf{X}$ corresponds to an example in the minibatch,\n","with some abuse of notation, we define the nonlinearity\n","$\\sigma$ to apply to its inputs in a rowwise fashion,\n","i.e., one example at a time.\n","Note that we used the notation for softmax\n","in the same way to denote a rowwise operation in :numref:`subsec_softmax_vectorization`.\n","Often, as in this section, the activation functions\n","that we apply to hidden layers are not merely rowwise,\n","but elementwise.\n","That means that after computing the linear portion of the layer,\n","we can calculate each activation\n","without looking at the values taken by the other hidden units.\n","This is true for most activation functions.\n","\n","\n","To build more general MLPs, we can continue stacking\n","such hidden layers,\n","e.g., $\\mathbf{H}^{(1)} = \\sigma_1(\\mathbf{X} \\mathbf{W}^{(1)} + \\mathbf{b}^{(1)})$\n","and $\\mathbf{H}^{(2)} = \\sigma_2(\\mathbf{H}^{(1)} \\mathbf{W}^{(2)} + \\mathbf{b}^{(2)})$,\n","one atop another, yielding ever more expressive models.\n","\n","### Universal Approximators\n","\n","MLPs can capture complex interactions\n","among our inputs via their hidden neurons,\n","which depend on the values of each of the inputs.\n","We can easily design hidden nodes\n","to perform arbitrary computation,\n","for instance, basic logic operations on a pair of inputs.\n","Moreover, for certain choices of the activation function,\n","it is widely known that MLPs are universal approximators.\n","Even with a single-hidden-layer network,\n","given enough nodes (possibly absurdly many),\n","and the right set of weights,\n","we can model any function,\n","though actually learning that function is the hard part.\n","You might think of your neural network\n","as being a bit like the C programming language.\n","The language, like any other modern language,\n","is capable of expressing any computable program.\n","But actually coming up with a program\n","that meets your specifications is the hard part.\n","\n","Moreover, just because a single-hidden-layer network\n","*can* learn any function\n","does not mean that you should try\n","to solve all of your problems\n","with single-hidden-layer networks.\n","In fact, we can approximate many functions\n","much more compactly by using deeper (vs. wider) networks.\n","We will touch upon more rigorous arguments in subsequent
